These codes are for tactile sensor developed in Cognitive robotics and Intelligent Systems for the People (CRISP) 
part of Advanced Robotics Lab (ARQ) at Queen Mary University of London.

Code involves acquisition of data throught I2C communication protocol. The sensors have same address, so we are using data multiplexing.

We are using 96 array of sensors capable of sensing forces applied in three dimesnions.

This is a work in progress, the frequency of data needs more improvement.
